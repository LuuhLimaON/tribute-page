                <li><strong>Alan Turing is the father of modern computer science</strong></li>
                <p>Turing essentially pioneered the idea of computer memory. In 1936, Turing published a seminal paper
                    called “On Computable Numbers”, which The Washington Post has called “the founding document of
                    the computer age.” In the philosophical article, he hypothesized that one day, we could build
                    machines that could compute any problem that a human could, using 0s and 1s. Turing proposed
                    single-task machines called Turing machines that would be capable of solving just one type of math
                    problem, but a “universal computer” would be able to tackle any kind of problem thrown at it by
                    storing instructional code in the computer’s memory. Turing’s ideas about memory storage and using a
                    single machine to carry out all tasks laid the foundation for what would become the digital
                    computer.

                    In 1945, while working for the UK’s National Physical Laboratory, he came up with the Automatic
                    Computing Machine, the first digital computer with stored programs. Previous computers didn’t have
                    electric memory storage, and had to be manually rewired to switch between different programs.</p>

                <li><strong>He was prosecuted for being homosexual</strong></li>
                <p>In 1952, Turing was arrested after reporting a burglary in his home. In the course of the
                    investigation, the police discovered Turing’s relationship with another man, Arnold Murray.
                    Homosexual relationships were illegal in the UK at the time, and he was charged with “gross
                    indecency.” He pled guilty on the advice of his lawyer, and opted to undergo chemical castration
                    instead of serving time in jail.</p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>His full genius wasn't recognized in his lifetime</strong></li>
                <p>Alan Turing was a well-respected mathematician in his time, but his contemporaries didn’t know the
                    full extent of his contributions to the world. Turing’s work breaking the Enigma machine remained
                    classified long after his death, meaning that his contributions to the war effort and to mathematics
                    were only partially known to the public during his lifetime. It wasn’t until the 1970s that his
                    instrumental role in the Allies' World War II victory became public with the declassification of the
                    Enigma story. The actual techniques Turing used to decrypt the messages weren’t declassified until
                    2013, when two of his papers from Bletchley Park were released to the British National Archives.</p>
